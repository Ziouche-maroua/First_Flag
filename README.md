## 📖 Scenario

The old university library's computer system has recently been compromised. The head librarian suspects that sensitive internal data — including parts of the library's security protocols — may have been stolen or tampered with.

Fortunately, the system administrator had made a backup of the main server **just before** the incident. You're handed this disk archive to investigate and uncover what’s been hidden.

## 🕵️ Your Mission

Analyze the provided disk image and recover the **full flag**, which has been deliberately fragmented and concealed across the system. Each piece you find will bring you closer to understanding what really happened.

The flag is divided into **three parts**, and you'll need to **link them using underscores** (`_`).
